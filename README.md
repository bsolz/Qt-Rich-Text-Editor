# QT-Creator-Text-Editor
## What Is It?
A mini project made in QT Creator in which I made a very basic rich text editor using classes and objects written in C++.

The code base was based of [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I96uPDifZ1w&t=1123s)

However it was expanded upon by adding features that were not in the main tutorial such as:

- Using custom icons
- Making text bold
- Italicizing text
- Underlining text
- Alligning text left, middle and right
- Changing font size (from 8 point to 32 points)
